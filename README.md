# FireFly Samples

This repository contains sample applications built on top of [FireFly](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly) using [firefly-sdk](https://github.com/hyperledger/firefly-sdk-nodejs). Use the links below to try out the samples.

Function specific samples:

- The simplest examples to start with are [private-data-transfer-cli](private-data-transfer-cli), which
implements a basic CLI workflow, and [private-data-transfer-ui](private-data-transfer-ui), which
implements the same flow in a React frontend app.

Combined samples:
